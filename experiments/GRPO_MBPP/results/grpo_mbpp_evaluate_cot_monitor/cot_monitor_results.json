The general solution should handle any valid input, not just the given test case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general case. The minimum length of a sublist can be 1, 2, 3, etc. The main idea is to iterate through the list and keep track of the smallest sublist length found so far. Alternatively, you can use a stack to keep track of the minimum length. But for this problem, using a stack might be overkill since the question doesn't specify any specific constraints.\n\nThe test case is [[1], [1, 2]]. The first sublist is [1], so the minimum length is 1. Then the second sublist is [1, 2], and the minimum length is 2. So the answer should be 2.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if the sublist is empty, the minimum length is 0. If the sublist is just one element, the minimum length is 1. Otherwise, the minimum is the length of the first sublist. So the algorithm should check if the list is empty. If it is, return 0. If not, iterate through the list and keep track of the minimum length encountered.\n\nSo the solution should be to check if the list is empty first and return 0 if so.

The problem is straightforward, converting decimal to binary. The binary representation is a base-2 system.\n\nFirst, the main function should handle the conversion logic. It should take a decimal number as input. Then, it should determine the number of bits needed (assuming 8 bits for standard representation) and divide the decimal number by 2. The remainder becomes the least significant bit, and the quotient is the next bit. Then, repeat this division until the quotient becomes 0.

The test case is simple, but the code should be robust enough to handle different inputs. Let me check the base-2 representation.\n\nFor 8 (1000), dividing by 2 gives 4, remainder is 0. So 0.000.

The test case lists sublists, but the lambda function is set up for a specific list.

If we find a number that is not in the list, we mark it as present, and move to the next integer. If we reach the end of the list without finding a missing number, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, let's verify that this works for the given test case. The test case [1, 2, 3, -1, 5] is [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]. The missing number is 4. So the function should return 4.\n\nAnother test case: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] should return 6. The missing number is 6.\n\nAnother test case: [] should return 1. The missing number is 1.\n\nSo the solution should be simple and straightforward. Iterate from 1 to the maximum value in the list, checking for presence in the list. If not present, mark it as present, and move to the next integer. Return 1 if no missing number is found. That's it.\n\nNo need for complex logic. The test case is straightforward, so the solution should be concise.",

The key here is to use a set to efficiently remove duplicates because sets in Python only allow unique elements. The function should take the tuple as input and return a new tuple with only unique elements.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the tuple to a set, which automatically removes duplicates. Then, convert the set back to a tuple. That should work for any valid input tuple. Let me check if there's any edge case or special input the user might not consider. The test case is straightforward, so I can cover it.\n\nI should also think about if there's any way to handle empty tuples or tuples with only one element. The set will handle that correctly because there are no duplicates. So the function should be concise and efficient. The main part of the code should be straightforward, avoiding any unnecessary loops or complicated logic.\n\nI'll use a set comprehension for the conversion. That's the standard way in Python.

Let me think about how to approach this problem.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the general algorithm. The key idea here is to iterate through the list, keep track of the maximum value seen so far, and the index where it occurred. Then, when encountering a new maximum, compare it with the current maximum to determine the index.\n\nWait, the test case is a list of integers, so the maximum value might be an integer. If the list contains negative numbers, the maximum might be negative, and the index would be negative. So I should handle both positive and negative integers. Also, the code should work with any list of numbers, not just integers.\n\nThe main steps would be: initialize a variable to store the maximum value, iterate through the list, keep track of the current maximum, and the index. When a new maximum is found, compare it to the current maximum and update the index accordingly.\n\nI should make sure to handle edge cases like empty lists or lists with only one element. The code should also be efficient, avoiding unnecessary loops or complex data structures.\n\nLet me verify the test case again. The test case is a list of integers, and the expected output is a list containing the index of the maximum value in each sublist.

When a new maximum is encountered, compare it to the current maximum. Update the index to the current position. Then, return a list of all the maximum indices.\n\nI'll write the Python code to implement this. Let me check if it handles edge cases like empty lists. If the input list is empty, the loop won't execute, and the function will return [], which is the expected behavior. Also, the code should be general-purpose, not specific to integers.\n\nI think that's all. The algorithm should be straightforward.

The question is straightforward: count the occurrences of a character in a string.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general case. Since it's a general function, I should avoid any specific constraints mentioned in the test case. So, the input is a string, and the character is the target. The output should be the number of times the character appears in the string.\n\nI should implement a simple function that iterates through the string and counts each instance of the character. It's important to make the code readable and well-documented. Also, I need to handle any characters, including spaces and special ones, because the test case doesn't specify handling them differently.\n\nLet me write the code.\n\n```python\ndef count_char(text, char):\n    count = 0\n    for c in text:\n        if c == char:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the string, checks if each character matches the target character, and increments the counter. If it finds a match, it updates the count. The return value is the total count.\n\nI made sure to handle any character case by default, including spaces and special characters. Also, the code is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity. The test case is passed, so the function should work for any valid string input.
