            "We need to compute the sum of the first 100 natural numbers. Recall that the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is: S = n * (a + l)/2, where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. Here, n = 100, a = 1, l = 100. Plugging these values into the formula, we have:\n",

The key here is that 100 is an even number and 101 is an odd number. The arithmetic series sum formula only works if the common difference (0 in this case) is odd. Since 0 is even, even when we add one term and subtract another term (e.g., 100+1 = 101, 100+2 = 102, etc.), the series still works like this:  1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100. The general term is 101 - 1 = 100, so the formula is perfectly valid here. The only mistake was calculating the number of pairs (100+1)/2 = 50 and 100(1+1)/2 = 5050. My original result of 5050 is correct.  The sum from 1 to 100 is (100 * 101)/2 = 5050.  So the answer must be 5050.  I thought 5050 was 50*101 = 5050. So, the calculation is straightforward:  100 * (1 + 100) / 2 = 5050.\n",
